/**
 * Product category management package for SIGRAP.
 *
 * <p>This package provides functionality for managing product categories, including:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Category CRUD operations</li>
 *   <li>Category hierarchy management</li>
 *   <li>Category-product relationships</li>
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * <p>Categories are used to organize {@link com.sigrap.product.Product} entities
 * and provide a hierarchical structure for product organization. Each product
 * must belong to exactly one category.</p>
 *
 * <p>The package follows the same layered architecture pattern as other feature packages,
 * with clear separation between controllers, services, and data access layers.</p>
